Code:


# Read the two numbers from the user
read -p "Enter the first number: " num1
read -p "Enter the second number: " num2

# Addition
add=$((num1 + num2))
echo "Addition: $num1 + $num2 = $add"

# Subtraction
sub=$((num1 - num2))
echo "Subtraction: $num1 - $num2 = $sub"

# Multiplication
mul=$((num1 * num2))
echo "Multiplication: $num1 * $num2 = $mul"

# Division
div=$((num1 / num2))
echo "Division: $num1 / $num2 = $div"
